# Semiconductors

## Introduction
**Metals** - Overlap of valence and conduction bands

**Semiconductors** - Valence and conduction band gap $ 0.5 < E_{g} < 2eV  \small \text{(non-strict values)} $

**Insulators** - Valence and conduction band gap $ E_{g} > 2eV  \small \text{(non-strict values)} $

## Conductivity
Semiconductor Conductivity - Dependent on Electron/Hole Concentration and Drift Velocity

$
n = \small\text{ Electron Concentration in Conduction Band } \qquad E > E_{c} \\
p = \small\text{ Hole Concentration in Valence Band } \qquad E < E_{v} \\
n_{i} = \small\text{ Intrinsic Carrier Concentration } \\
$

### Intrinsic Carriers
For undoped semiconductors (ie. intrinsic semiconductors), at thermal equilibrium, $ n_{0} = p_{0} = n_{i} $ (where $ n_{i} $ is a **temperature-dependent material property**).

This essentially means that the "default" number of charge carriers is the number of electrons in the conduction band which is equivalent to the number of holes in the valence band (since the electrons have moved from the valence band to the conduction band). 

### Semiconductor Doping
Consider silicon lattice:
(Insert Image Here)

#### N-Type Dopant (Electron Donor)
- Group 5 Element - Atom contributes an electron to the lattice

$ N_{D}^{+} = \small\text{Number of Ionised Donors} \ (cm^{-3})$
$$ n = p + N_{D}^{+} $$

#### P-Type Dopant (Electron Acceptor / Hole Donor)
- Group 3 Element - Atom contributes a hole to the lattice

$ N_{A}^{-} = \small\text{Number of Ionised Acceptors} \ (cm^{-3})$
$$ p = n + N_{A}^{-} $$
